# CrowdGuard AI - Prototype

## Project Overview
CrowdGuard AI is an intelligent, real-time crowd monitoring and management platform designed for large-scale events like the Mahakumbh pilgrimage in Ujjain.
It empowers event organizers, security personnel, and administrators to monitor crowd density, respond to emergencies, and manage resources efficiently using a modern, role-based web application.

## How It Works
1. **User Registration** â†’ Users sign up & select their role; profiles are auto-created via Supabase triggers.
2. **Role-Based Access** â†’ After login, dashboards are tailored based on the user role.
3. **Live Monitoring** â†’ Security/Admin users access live video feeds; AI detects people & calculates crowd density in real-time.
4. **Incident Management** â†’ Security teams receive alerts & manage incidents seamlessly.
5. **Pilgrim Support** â†’ Pilgrims view safety alerts, recommendations, and lost & found items.
6. **Analytics & Reporting** â†’ Admins visualize **heatmaps**, **sentiment trends**, and **real-time analytics**.
